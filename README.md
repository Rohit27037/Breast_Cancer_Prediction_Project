# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction Project

Welcome to the **Breast Cancer Prediction** project!  
This beginner-friendly project walks through a step-by-step machine learning pipeline to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can **accurately predict** whether a tumor is:

- **Malignant (M)** or  
- **Benign (B)**  

based on a set of medical measurements.

We use the dataset **`Cancer_Data.csv`** for this task.

## 🧪 Model Used

- **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet powerful classification algorithm used here to predict tumor classes.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Name**: `Cancer_Data.csv`
- The dataset contains diagnostic features computed from breast mass cell nuclei images (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness, etc.).

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**
2. **Load Dataset**
3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
4. **Train-Test Split**
5. **Model Building: Logistic Regression**
6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy score
   - Confusion matrix
   - Classification report
7. **Prediction on New Data (if applicable)**

## 📊 Results

- The Logistic Regression model achieved **high accuracy**, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying breast tumors using basic diagnostic features.
